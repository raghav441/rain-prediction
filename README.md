Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-Learn

In this project, I implement Logistic Regression with Python and Scikit-Learn. I build a classifier to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia by training a binary classification model using Logistic Regression. I have used the Rain in Australia dataset downloaded from the Kaggle website for this project.
